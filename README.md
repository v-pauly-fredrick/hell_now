# hell_now
Just a small kit of scripts and scraps of code that will help me stay sane working on now, now, ServiceNow!!!!

Well, the goal is to build-up an arsenal of scripts, snippets, etc., and then slam them together into something more meaningful and REALLY useful. 

On a serious note, this repo's primary focus is to save my (developer) time, reduce errors, make maintenance a bit smoother. I have seen a decent amount of bad stuff and I intend to have a toolkit that I can use to deal with and prevent "oh no" moments. 

P.S. English isnâ€™t my first language, so excuse any little grammar slip-ups!
