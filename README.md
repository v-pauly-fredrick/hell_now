Just a small kit of scripts and scraps of code that will help me stay sane working on now, now, ServiceNow!!!!

Well, the goal is build-up an arsenal of scripts, snippets, etc., and then slam them together into something more meaningful and REALLY useful. 

On a serious note, this library will full of code, where the primary focus is to save my (developer) time, reduce errors, make maintenance a bit smoother. 

I have seen a decent amount of bad stuff and I intend to have a toolkit that I can use to deal with or prevent things going/gone wrong.
